This is Disaster Tweet Dataset . 
The task is to do sentiment classification

In this we have used multiple techniques:

First we started with RandomForest.
Then Tried another model called continuous bag of words.
for which the test accuracy was 0.78

Then Tried the LSTM with embedding . 
Using that i got the test accuracy of 0.82
